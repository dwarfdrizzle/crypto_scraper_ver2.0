        <h1> Data handling and usage</h1>
        <h2>
            Our Commitment
        </h2>
        <p>
            At Cryptick, we value the data of our users and are committed to being transparent about how we collect, use, 
            and share information. This commitment outlines our practices regarding data collection and 
            usage, particularly in relation to Google Analytics and advertising.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Data Collection and Usage
        </h2>
        <p>
            Cryptick utilizes Google Analytics to gather insights about user interactions on our platform. 
            This includes, but is not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li><b>User Behavior</b>: How you navigate through our site, the pages you visit, and the time spent on those pages.</li>
                <li><b>Device and Browser Information</b>: the type of device and browser you use to access Cryptick, which helps us optimize your user experience.</li>
                <li><b>Location data</b>: General location information to understand where our users come from, allowing us to tailor our content more effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data collected through Google Analytics helps us improve our platform, ensuring that we continually meet our users' needs and preferences.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>
            Advertising and Tracking
        </h2>
        <p>
            To support our platform and provide a free service, Cryptick displays ads. These ads are served based on the tracking data provided by Google, which includes:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ad Personalization</b>: Ads are personalized based on your previous interactions, browsing behavior, and preferences.</li>
                <li><b>Tracking Technologies</b>: Google uses cookies and similar technologies to track user behavior and serve relevant ads.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Data Storage and Security
        </h2>
        <p>
            While Google Analytics collects and stores data on our behalf, Cryptick itself does not directly store personal user data. We rely on the robust security measures 
            provided by Google to protect your data. We do not have access to individual user data stored by Google Analytics.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Your Rights and Choices
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a Cryptick user, you have certain rights and choices regarding the data collected by Google Analytics:
            <li><b>Cookie Preferences</b>: You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</li>
            <li><b>Opt-out Tools</b>: Google provides tools to opt-out of data collection and advertising personalization. More information can be 
            found in Google's Privacy & Terms.</li>        
        </p>
